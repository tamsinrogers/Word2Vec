# CS421-project2: Python2Vec

## Abstract ##
This project involved implementing a Python2Vec model by training a Word2Vec model with python code.  I applied the Word2Vec model to source code in order to create my own verison, Python2Vec.  In this project, I created several Jupyter Notebooks in which I mined public software repositories for Python code.  I then cleaned my data and trained a Word2Vec model with the source code I collected from the repositiories. I then assesed the model I created and used it to determine the similarity of identifiers in code.  In doing so, I successfully practiced the basics of mining software repositories and data cleaning and tested my model with real-life data to check the similarity of identifiers in code.


## Results ##
I trained my model on the matplotlib and scipy repositories, and created a model using X tokens.

## Discussion ##
I determined the following similarities of identifiers in code mined form the repositories I chose:
