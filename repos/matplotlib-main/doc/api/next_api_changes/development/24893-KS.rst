Maximum line length increased to 88 characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum line length for new contributions has been extended from 79 characters to
88 characters.
This change provides an extra 9 characters to allow code which is a single idea to fit
on fewer lines (often a single line).
The chosen length is the same as `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#line-length>`_.
