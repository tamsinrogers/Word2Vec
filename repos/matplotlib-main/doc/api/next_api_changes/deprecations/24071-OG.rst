Passing undefined *label_mode* to ``Grid``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... is deprecated. This includes `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_grid.Grid`,
`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_grid.AxesGrid`, and
`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_grid.ImageGrid` as well as the corresponding
classes imported from `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_grid`.

Pass ``label_mode='keep'`` instead to get the previous behavior of not modifying labels.
