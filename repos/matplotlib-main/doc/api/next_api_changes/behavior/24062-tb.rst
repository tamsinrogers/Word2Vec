``TrapezoidMapTriFinder`` uses different random number generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random number generator used to determine the order of insertion of
triangle edges in ``TrapezoidMapTriFinder`` has changed. This can result in a
different triangle index being returned for a point that lies exactly on an
edge between two triangles. This can also affect triangulation interpolation
and refinement algorithms that use ``TrapezoidMapTriFinder``.
