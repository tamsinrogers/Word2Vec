Figure legends can be placed outside figures using constrained_layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Constrained layout will make space for Figure legends if they are specified
by a *loc* keyword argument that starts with the string "outside". The
codes are unique from axes codes, in that "outside upper right" will
make room at the top of the figure for the legend, whereas
"outside right upper" will make room on the right-hand side of the figure.
See :doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/legend_guide` for details.
